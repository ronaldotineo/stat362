    "- **Reduced Bugs**: Fewer loops mean fewer opportunities for indexing errors\n",
    "- **Mathematical Clarity**: Code structure mirrors mathematical notation more closely\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Easier to read, understand, and modify vectorized implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel Processing Power**\n",

    "### Prerequisite: Matrix Operations in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Fundamentals\n",
    "Matrices are two-dimensional arrays where all elements are of the same data type. They form the backbone of linear algebra operations in machine learning and are essential for efficient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Notation and Conventions\n",
    "- **Matrix Notation**: Matrices are denoted with capital, bold letters such as $\\mathbf{X}$, $\\mathbf{W}$, $\\mathbf{A}$\n",
    "- **Dimensions**: \n",
    "  - $m$ = number of rows (typically represents number of training examples)\n",
    "  - $n$ = number of columns (typically represents number of features)\n",
    "  - Matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design Matrix with Bias Term\n",
    "In machine learning, we often augment our feature matrix to include a bias term. The bias $b$ is incorporated as the **first column** of the matrix, consisting of all ones. This allows us to combine the bias and weights into a single matrix operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{augmented}} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & x_1^{(1)} & x_2^{(1)} & \\cdots & x_n^{(1)} \\\\\n",
    "1 & x_1^{(2)} & x_2^{(2)} & \\cdots & x_n^{(2)} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "1 & x_1^{(m)} & x_2^{(m)} & \\cdots & x_n^{(m)}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times (n+1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits of Bias Integration:**\n",
    "- **Simplified Computation**: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}_{\\text{augmented}} \\mathbf{w}$ instead of $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w} + b$\n",
    "- **Vectorized Operations**: All parameters (weights + bias) updated simultaneously\n",
    "- **Cleaner Implementation**: Reduces code complexity and potential for errors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Element Indexing\n",
    "- **Superscript notation**: $x^{(i)}$ refers to the $i^{th}$ training example\n",
    "- **Subscript notation**: $x_j^{(i)}$ refers to the $j^{th}$ feature of the $i^{th}$ training example\n",
    "- **Python indexing**: Remember that NumPy uses 0-based indexing (first element is index 0)"

    "**1. `np.dot()` - The Classic Approach**\n",
    "- Most versatile NumPy function for matrix operations\n",

    "- Cleaner, more readable syntax that mirrors mathematical notation\n",
    "- Specifically designed for matrix multiplication\n",
    "- **Recommended for new code**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. `np.matmul()` - The Explicit Matrix Multiplication**\n",
    "- Explicitly designed for matrix multiplication\n",
    "- Similar to `@` operator (in fact, `@` calls `matmul` internally)\n",
    "- Useful when you want to emphasize that you're doing matrix multiplication\n",
    "- Handles broadcasting differently than `np.dot()` for higher dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Multiplication Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "For matrix multiplication $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$:\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{A}$ has shape $(m, k)$\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{B}$ has shape $(k, n)$\n",
    "- Result $\\mathbf{C}$ has shape $(m, n)$\n",
    "- **Critical Rule**: Number of columns in $\\mathbf{A}$ must equal number of rows in $\\mathbf{B}$\n",

    "#### Example Below\n",
    "In the code cells below, we'll demonstrate all three methods with:\n",
    "- `matrix_a`: shape $(2, 3)$ - 2 rows, 3 columns\n",

    "## Scikit-learn: Linear Regression with Closed-Form Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides the [`LinearRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) class, which implements a **closed-form solution** for linear regression using the **Normal Equation**. This approach computes the optimal weights directly through matrix algebra, without requiring iterative optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation: The Normal Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The closed-form solution derives from calculus by setting the gradient of the cost function to zero and solving for $\\mathbf{w}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **No iterations required** - Computes optimal weights in one step\n",
    "- ✅ **No learning rate needed** - No hyperparameters to tune\n",
    "- ✅ **Exact solution** - Finds global minimum directly (no convergence issues)\n",
    "- ✅ **No feature scaling required** - Works with raw features\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Closed-Form vs. Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "| Factor | Closed-Form Solution | Gradient Descent |\n",
    "|--------|---------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Dataset Size** | Small to medium (< 10,000 examples) | Large datasets (millions of examples) |\n",
    "| **Computation** | $O(n^3)$ due to matrix inversion | $O(kn)$ where k = iterations |\n",
    "| **Speed** | Fast for small $n$ | Faster for large $n$ |\n",
    "| **Scalability** | Poor - requires inverting $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$ | Excellent - iterative updates |\n",
    "| **Feature Scaling** | **Not required** ✓ | Required for good performance |\n",
    "| **Hyperparameters** | None | Learning rate, iterations |\n",
    "| **Convergence** | Always finds exact solution | May need tuning for convergence |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Computational Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix Inversion Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Normal Equation requires computing $(\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1}$\n",
    "- For $n$ features, this is an $(n \\times n)$ matrix\n",
    "- Matrix inversion has computational complexity of $O(n^3)$\n",
    "- **Becomes impractical when $n > 10,000$ features**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Must store $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}$ matrix in memory\n",
    "- For 10,000 features: $(10^4)^2 = 100$ million elements\n",
    "- Can cause memory issues on large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Closed-Form Solution Works Best\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Ideal Scenarios:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small to medium datasets (like our house price example)\n",
    "- Number of features < 1,000\n",
    "- Need quick, exact solution without tuning\n",
    "- Educational purposes to understand optimal parameters\n",
    "- Baseline model for comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Avoid When:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large datasets (> 100,000 examples)\n",
    "- High-dimensional data (> 10,000 features)\n",
    "- Real-time or streaming data scenarios\n",
    "- Computational resources are limited\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note on Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **The closed-form solution does NOT require feature normalization.**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Unlike gradient descent, which converges faster with normalized features, the Normal Equation produces the same optimal weights regardless of feature scales. This is because it solves the optimization problem algebraically rather than iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation in Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In Task 6 below, you'll use `LinearRegression` to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fit the model using the Normal Equation\n",
    "2. Extract learned parameters (bias and weights)\n",
    "3. Compare results with your gradient descent implementation\n",
    "4. Verify that different methods converge to the same solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights learned from `LinearRegression` should be very close to those from your gradient descent implementation, validating both approaches!"

    "\n",
    "- Features with large ranges (e.g., house size: 500-5000 sqft) cause large gradients\n",
    "- Features with small ranges (e.g., bedrooms: 1-5) cause small gradients\n",
    "- One learning rate cannot work well for both → slow or unstable convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All features have similar ranges (typically mean=0, std=1)\n",
    "- Gradients are balanced across all features\n",
    "- Learning rate works uniformly → **fast, stable convergence** ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling Methods:**\n",

    "# StandardScaler: (x - mean) / std_dev → mean=0, std=1\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()\n",

    "- **Large datasets** (> 100,000 examples)\n",
    "- **Online/streaming data** (model updates as new data arrives)\n",
    "- **Limited memory** (cannot load entire dataset)\n",
    "- **High-dimensional data** (many features)\n",
    "- **Quick approximate solution** needed\n",
    "- **Scalability** is critical\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Avoid SGD When:**\n",

    "x_new = [1650, 3, 2, 20]\n",
    "prediction = model.predict([x_new])  # Will give wrong result!\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✓ CORRECT - Scaling new features first\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why Scaling Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your models were trained on **scaled features** (mean=0, std=1)\n",
    "- New data must be transformed using the **same scaling parameters**\n",
    "- Use `scaler.transform()` (NOT `fit_transform()`) on new data\n",
    "- `fit_transform()` would compute NEW scaling parameters → wrong predictions!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Approaches for Each Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Your Gradient Descent Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Manually create feature vector with bias term\n",
    "x_new = np.array([1, x1_scaled, x2_scaled, x3_scaled, x4_scaled])\n",
    "prediction = np.dot(w, x_new)  # or w @ x_new\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. LinearRegression (sklearn):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Use .predict() method (handles bias automatically)\n",
    "x_new_scaled = scaler.transform([[1650, 3, 2, 20]])\n",
    "prediction = lr_model.predict(x_new_scaled)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. SGDRegressor (sklearn):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Use .predict() method (handles bias automatically)\n",
    "x_new_scaled = scaler.transform([[1650, 3, 2, 20]])\n",
    "prediction = sgd_model.predict(x_new_scaled)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Should See:**\n",
    "\n",
    "All three predictions should be **very close** to each other:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Gradient Descent Prediction: $292,450\n",
    "Linear Regression Prediction: $292,470\n",
    "SGD Regressor Prediction:     $292,430\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- All predictions within **2-3% of each other** ✓\n",
    "- Predictions make **intuitive sense** (reasonable house price) ✓\n",
    "- No negative prices or extreme outliers ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "### What If Predictions Differ Significantly?\n",
    "\n",
    "**If predictions vary by more than 5%, check:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Scaling Issues**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Did you scale the new features using the same scaler?\n",
    "   - Are you using `transform()` not `fit_transform()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bias Term Handling**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For your GD model: Did you prepend `1` for the bias?\n",
    "   - For sklearn models: They handle bias automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Convergence**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Did your gradient descent fully converge?\n",
    "   - Check the cost plot - should flatten out\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parameter Extraction**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For sklearn models: Using `intercept_` and `coef_` correctly?"
