    "\n",
    "**The Moment of Truth!** \n",
    "Now that you have trained your model and found optimal parameters $w$ and $b$, it's time to put your **prediction machine** to work! This is where all your hard work pays off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Your Prediction Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Prediction Formula:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Breaking Down Each Component:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$w$ (slope)** = Price increase per 1000 sqft → *\"How much more does each additional 1000 sqft cost?\"*\n",
    "- **$b$ (y-intercept)** = Base price when size = 0 → *\"What's the starting price before considering square footage?\"*\n",
    "- **$x^{(i)}$ (input)** = House size in thousands of sqft → *\"The feature we're using to predict\"*\n",
    "- **$f_{w,b}(x^{(i)})$ (output)** = Predicted price in thousands of dollars → *\"Our model's best guess\"*\n",

    "> *\"I'm interested in buying a house with exactly **1200 square feet**. Based on recent market data, what should I expect to pay?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Mission:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use your trained parameters** $(w, b)$ found by gradient descent\n",
    "2. **Convert units properly** (1200 sqft → thousands of sqft)\n",
    "3. **Calculate the prediction** using your linear model\n",
    "4. **Provide a professional estimate** to your client\n",
